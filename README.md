# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 coding challenges.
Advent of Code is a series of 25 small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. 
Each day, a new set of challenges is released, with two puzzles for each day. 
The puzzles are self-contained and are meant to be solved in any programming language.
